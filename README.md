# gt-hw-web-apis-quiz

## Description 

This is a homework requirement for GT Full Stack Flex Program. This webpage is designed to start a countdown when you click start quiz. It will then show an array of questions, subtracting 10 seconds when you get an answer wrong and keeping the same time when you get an answer right. At the end, you will input your initials to end the quiz and receive your score (the remaining time!)
